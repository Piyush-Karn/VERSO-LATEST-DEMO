The previous AI engineer incrementally developed the Verso travel app, focusing on UI/UX, data enrichment, and new feature implementation. Initially, the  was deeply enriched, and a FastAPI endpoint was set up. Key features included an interactive Neighborhoods experience, a refactored navigation hierarchy, and a redesigned Your Trip section into a companion-led itinerary. The engineer then focused on enhancing the trip questionnaire into a cinematic, non-linear companion flow, implemented in phases (Enhanced Inputs, Dynamic Summary, City Exploration). Concurrently, a premium onboarding experience and minor UI fixes (swipe issues, map navigation, profile section, collections heading) were addressed. The latest major task involves a complete overhaul of the itinerary view into a cinematic, scroll-based experience with detailed brand specifications, which is currently in its initial implementation stage.

Verso is an AI-native, mobile-first travel planning platform converting social media inspirations into cinematic itineraries. It prioritizes high-quality visuals, minimalist design, and a slow, consultative, magazine-like interaction.
**Core Features:** Personalized trip vaults (Home Screen), persistent bottom navigation (Explore, Collections, Your Trip, Ask Verso), vault detail page with city-focused navigation, Instagram Reels-like feeds for city activities/cafes, a Mapbox-powered globe for exploration, and an AI co-pilot.
**Key Developments & Redesigns:**
1.  **Data Refinement:**  enriched with storytelling, seasonality, and cost details.
2.  **Navigation Refactor:** Shifted to city-specific tabs, integrating seasonality as chips/filters.
3.  **Neighborhoods Experience:** Cinematic cards for neighborhoods, detail pages, and hotel bottom sheets.
4.  **Trip Planning Redesign (Original):** Your Trip into a companion-led itinerary () with dynamic metrics and bottom sheets.
5.  **Trip Questionnaire (First Redesign):** Companion-led, cinematic, single-question-per-screen flow.
6.  **Trip Planning Redesign (Current - Non-linear):** Non-linear, cinematic, and intelligent experience allowing co-creation in any order. This includes an enhanced initial input flow (Phase 1), a dynamic summary hub (Phase 2), and deep city exploration (Phase 3).
7.  **Premium Onboarding:** A 4-screen cinematic flow to collect user travel history and preferences.
8.  **Cinematic Itinerary View:** A complete visual and motion overhaul to present itineraries as a scrollable, luxury travel magazine experience from Vault Awakening to Journey Complete with specific brand guidelines.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive redesign of the itinerary views, moving towards an AI-native, cinematic, scroll-based experience that feels like a luxury travel magazine. This involves a multi-screen flow (Vault Awakening, Trip Overview, City Timeline, Day-by-Day Details, Journey Complete) with highly specific visual, motion, and component architecture details provided by the user.

The engineer has just started implementing this major redesign. A new file, , has been created to house this experience, adhering to the Verso brand specifications. The very last action recorded was the creation of this  and the immediate next step is to add its route and update existing navigation to integrate this new, advanced itinerary view. The previous step's test results confirmed the initial  showing the vault transition, Day 1 card, hero typography, activities, floating actions, and off-white background, confirming the design aligns with Verso's aesthetic.
