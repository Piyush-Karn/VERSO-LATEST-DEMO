The AI engineer's work began with a complex migration of the Verso app from Expo React Native to a Vite + React web stack, involving extensive configuration and debugging to ensure core functionality. Following this, the focus shifted to implementing the specified UI/UX designs. Key milestones included building the Vault View home page with interactive cards, refining the bottom navigation to include Explore, Collections, Your Trip, and Ask Verso tabs, and restoring the detailed Vault Detail Page with Pexels-powered image galleries and a single-question-per-screen questionnaire. A significant effort was made to integrate a dynamic Mapbox GL JS globe for the Explore tab, incorporating interactive pins and filter chips. The most recent work involved creating a comprehensive static travel dataset to power the demo, and critically, performing QA to resolve inconsistencies in data mapping and swipe interactions across various views. The current state is a discussion with the user regarding the precise structure of this dataset.

Verso is a mobile-first travel planning platform organizing social media inspirations into structured itineraries. The design is aspirational, minimalist, and serene, emphasizing high-quality visuals and a slow, consultative, magazine-like interaction.

**Key Features (Existing & New on Vite+React):**
- **Home Screen (Vault View):** Personalized trip vaults as full-screen, edge-to-edge cards with horizontal swipe, soft parallax, card lift, and a reactive map backdrop. Includes Ambient Intelligence lines.
- **Persistent Bottom Navigation:** Explore, Collections, Your Trip, Ask Verso tabs.
- **Vault Detail Page:** Accessed by tapping a vault card, showing saved inspirations categorized by Cities, Things To Do, and Seasons. Features rich Pexels-integrated thumbnails and an improved seasons UI.
- **City-Level View & Things To Do Deep Dive:** Multi-layered navigation for activities and cafes, similar to Instagram Reels, with full-screen cards, swipe interactions, and detailed bottom sheets.
- **Explore Tab (Globe View):** A Mapbox-powered 2D globe (initially envisioned as 3D), with visited countries highlighted, ambient lighting, floating filter chips (When to travel, Travel vibe, How far away, Surprise me), and interactive pins that reveal micro-vault previews. It aims for a cinematic, tactile, and calm experience.
- **Trip Planning (Questionnaire):** A conversational, single-question-per-screen flow to gather trip details.
- **AI Co-pilot:** Ask Verso via Claude API.
- **Static Dataset:** A hierarchical dataset () providing realistic data for 6 countries, cities, activities, and cafes, with contextual imagery keywords, seasonality, themes, cost, and duration hints, ensuring non-repetition and dynamic filtering.

The application utilizes a FastAPI backend with a MongoDB database and a Vite + React frontend.



-   : Centralized routing using , orchestrates main layout and page components. Routes have been continuously updated to reflect new page implementations and navigation requirements (e.g., adding , , , , ).
-   : Provides the shared application layout, notably housing the dynamic bottom navigation bar that evolved to include Explore, Collections, Your Trip, and Ask Verso tabs. Also handles global styling and safe area context.
-   : Implements the core Your Collections home screen, displaying personalized trip vaults as horizontally swipeable cards with visual effects.
-   : Displays the detailed view for a selected country/vault, including Cities, Things To Do, and Seasons tabs. This file has been extensively modified to integrate Pexels API for rich city/activity thumbnails and to align with the new seasons UI. It now also serves as the country overview page when navigating from the Explore tab.
-   : Manages the multi-layered navigation for city-specific activities and cafes, presenting content in a vertical, Instagram Reels-like feed with detailed interaction options.
-   : Replaced earlier globe implementations, this file integrates  to render the interactive 2D globe for the Explore tab, featuring country highlights, pins, and filtering UI.
-   : The current implementation of the questionnaire, designed for a single question per screen to enhance user experience.
-   : A new service created to interface with the Pexels API, centralizing image fetching logic for dynamic content.
-   : A newly created static JSON file holding the hierarchical demo data for countries, cities, activities, and cafes, intended to power the entire frontend demo without API calls. This file is currently undergoing refinement to match a user-provided structure.
-   : Vite build configuration, adjusted multiple times to resolve CORS issues, optimize dependencies for , and manage the build process.
-   : Updated to store sensitive API keys like Mapbox and Pexels.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a crucial discussion with the user regarding the structure of the . The user had provided a detailed example of how the data for countries (specifically Bali and Thailand) should be structured, highlighting more granular and production-ready formats for  (as an array of objects with uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and ),  (with  and ),  (e.g., low-mid), and  (single string with multiple terms).

The AI engineer has compared its existing  structure with the user's example, identifying these key differences. The engineer has acknowledged that the user's proposed structure is superior for production readiness and better aligns with Pexels API queries. The current status is that the AI has presented these differences and is awaiting user confirmation on whether to proceed with updating the existing dataset to precisely match the user's preferred structure, maintain the current structure, or adopt a hybrid approach. This decision directly impacts the data layer that powers the entire Explore and Collections demo flow.
